            <h2 style={h2}>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using FlushPin (&quot;the Service&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our <a href="/privacy" style={link}>Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="/safety" style={link}>Safety Notice</a>, each incorporated by reference. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. These Terms apply to all users, including visitors, registered users, business subscribers, and businesses listed on the platform.</p>

            <h2 style={h2}>2. Description of service</h2>
            <p>FlushPin operates www.flushpin.com and the FlushPin mobile app. FlushPin provides location-based <strong>restroom intelligence</strong> for consumers and businesses — including access guidance, demand signals, experience information, community-reported access details where permitted or publicly available, ratings, and related feedback.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>FlushPin also offers optional paid business plans that may include restroom intelligence reports, listing management tools, alerts, customer recovery tools, and related business features as described on our website.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>The Service relies on community contributions, third-party place data, and automated systems. FlushPin does not guarantee that any restroom information is accurate, current, complete, available, safe, or suitable at any given time. Restroom access policies are set by businesses and may change without notice.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>Business names, addresses, and location details may come from third-party map or place data providers. FlushPin does not control and is not responsible for third-party data accuracy, completeness, or updates. Any trademarks or business names displayed belong to their respective owners.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>Terms such as &quot;verified&quot; or similar status indicators reflect platform review or reporting status — not a guarantee of accuracy, availability, cleanliness, safety, or ADA compliance.</p>

            <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', padding: '18px 20px', background: '#FEF3F2', border: '1.5px solid #FECACA', borderRadius: '12px' }}>
              <p style={{ margin: 0, fontWeight: '700', color: '#991B1B', fontSize: '15px' }}>FlushPin is NOT for medical emergencies.</p>
              <p style={{ margin: '8px 0 0', color: '#7F1D1D', fontSize: '14px', lineHeight: '1.7' }}>If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call emergency services (such as 911 in the United States) or seek immediate assistance. Do not rely on FlushPin in health emergencies or urgent medical situations.</p>
            </div>

            <p style={{ marginTop: '20px' }}><strong>FlushPin does not authorize entry into any restroom or business premises.</strong> FlushPin provides information only. You must follow posted business policies, staff instructions, customer requirements, and local law. Denied access, ejection, or trespass disputes are between you and the business — not FlushPin.</p>

              <li>You grant FlushPin a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, store, reproduce, modify, and distribute your contributions <strong>solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and providing the Service</strong> — including aggregated, anonymized, and statistical insights and reports.

              <li>You will not submit private information about individuals without their consent</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>Community-submitted information may be published, reviewed, accepted, rejected, edited, hidden, or removed at any time for safety, accuracy, business-owner request, legal, or platform integrity reasons. Some submissions may appear on the platform before manual review. FlushPin does not pre-verify all community contributions before display and has no obligation to monitor all user content, but may do so at its discretion.</p>

            <h2 style={h2}>7. Business relationship, listings, and opt-out</h2>
            <p>FlushPin does not own, operate, or endorse listed businesses. Listing a business does not mean FlushPin has permission to display access information or that the business participates in FlushPin.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>Businesses listed on FlushPin may be added by users, data partners, or the FlushPin team. If you are a business owner or authorized representative and wish to claim, correct, update, or remove your listing, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@flushpin.com" style={link}>admin@flushpin.com</a> or submit a request through our <a href="/optout" style={link}>business opt-out page</a>.</p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>We may request reasonable verification of your authority to act on behalf of a business. Verified opt-out, correction, or removal requests may limit or remove restroom access information for that business, even if community submissions conflict. We aim to review business requests promptly and will respond as soon as reasonably possible.</p>

If there is a conflict between these Terms and a signed written agreement or accepted order form, the signed agreement or order form controls for that business relationship.</p>
